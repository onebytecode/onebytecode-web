  "readme": "HTTP Strict Transport Security middleware\n========================================\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/helmetjs/hsts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helmetjs/hsts)\n[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)\n\n[_Looking for a changelog?_](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet/blob/master/HISTORY.md)\n\nThis middleware adds the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to the response. This tells browsers, \"hey, only use HTTPS for the next period of time\". ([See the spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797) for more.)\n\nThis will set the Strict Transport Security header, telling browsers to visit by HTTPS for the next 180 days:\n\n```javascript\nvar hsts = require('hsts')\n\napp.use(hsts({\n  maxAge: 15552000  // 180 days in seconds\n}))\n// Strict-Transport-Security: max-age: 15552000; includeSubDomains\n```\n\nNote that the max age must be in seconds. *This was different in previous versions of this module!*\n\nThe `includeSubDomains` directive is present by default. If this header is set on *example.com*, supported browsers will also use HTTPS on *my-subdomain.example.com*. You can disable this:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(hsts({\n  maxAge: 15552000,\n  includeSubDomains: false\n}))\n```\n\nChrome lets you submit your site for baked-into-Chrome HSTS by adding `preload` to the header. You can add that with the following code, and then submit your site to the Chrome team at [hstspreload.appspot.com](https://hstspreload.appspot.com/).\n\n```javascript\napp.use(hsts({\n  maxAge: 10886400,        // Must be at least 18 weeks to be approved by Google\n  includeSubDomains: true, // Must be enabled to be approved by Google\n  preload: true\n}))\n```\n\nThis header will be set `req.secure` is true, a boolean auto-populated by Express. If you're not using Express, that value won't necessarily be set, so you have two options:\n\n```javascript\n// Set the header based on a condition\napp.use(hsts({\n  maxAge: 1234000,\n  setIf: function (req, res) {\n    return req.secure || (req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'] === 'https')\n  }\n}))\n\n// ALWAYS set the header\napp.use(hsts({\n  maxAge: 1234000,\n  force: true\n}))\n```\n\nThis only works if your site actually has HTTPS. It won't tell users on HTTP to *switch* to HTTPS, it will just tell HTTPS users to stick around. You can enforce this with the [express-enforces-ssl](https://github.com/aredo/express-enforces-ssl) module. This header is [somewhat well-supported by browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stricttransportsecurity).\n",
